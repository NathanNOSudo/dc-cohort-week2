ADD IMPORTANT NOTES HERE!!!!

#class is a blueprint
Class # to declare class
#create a class
Class class_name:
	def __init__(self): 
		self.attribute = ""
#init function is initializer/constructor; set self to allow #attributes to class, can declare objects/attributes as arguments with init to allow minimum req input

#Inheritance of classes
#add another class into new class argument
#must reference types
#look to example of electric cars(line 35) must use either super(which calls on parent class, for #init else it can only use the functions) or class_name.
